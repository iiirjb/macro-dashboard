# Detailed Indicator Documentation

## Overview

This document provides in-depth explanations of the six indicators that comprise the Service Industrialization Master Dashboard. Each indicator represents a critical dimension of the macro AI economy:

- **PHYSICS**: Physical infrastructure constraints (energy)
- - **FACTORY**: Computational output and economic velocity
  - - **TRADE**: Asset allocation and capital commitment

    ## PHYSICS Module: Energy Constraints

    The PHYSICS module tracks the physical limitations and economic costs of compute infrastructure. Energy is the ultimate hard constraint on AI expansion.

    ### 1. PJM Power Price (The Ashburn Gap)

    **Full Name:** Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Electricity Prices

    **What It Measures:**
    Real-time wholesale electricity prices in the PJM Interconnection, the largest competitive power grid in North America. Ashburn, Virginia is the epicenter of US data center density, and PJM power prices directly determine the operating cost of compute clusters.

    **Technical Details:**
    - Measured in $/MWh (dollars per megawatt-hour)
    - - Baseline in this dashboard: ~$38/MWh
      - - Simulated spike after 65% of time period (represents seasonal/demand shock)
        - - Includes random normal distribution noise (volatility-scaled)
         
          - **Why It Matters:**
          - Electricity is a hard constraint. Unlike software that can scale with marginal cost approaching zero, every additional GPU cluster requires additional megawatts. When power prices spike:
          - - Training costs increase directly
            - - Less marginal compute gets deployed
              - - Data center buildout becomes less economical
                - - Older, less efficient facilities become stranded assets
                 
                  - **Economic Interpretation:**
                  - - **Rising prices** = Infrastructure bottleneck, energy supply-constrained, reduced AI expansion capacity
                    - - **Falling prices** = Energy abundance, enables larger training runs, encourages data center buildout
                      - - **Volatility** = Market uncertainty about supply/demand balance
                       
                        - **For Macro Investors:**
                        - This is the "ceiling on AI expansion." When power prices exceed ~$80-100/MWh sustained, you should expect:
                        - - Slower training deployment cycles
                          - - Shift toward more efficient model architectures (smaller, faster models)
                            - - Regional consolidation (all compute moves to cheapest power regions)
                              - - Pressure on semiconductor margins (less demand for GPUs)
                               
                                - **Example Signals:**
                                - - Sudden spike to $200+/MWh → Supply disruption (likely bearish for AI capex)
                                  - - Sustained elevation to $60-80/MWh → Structural tightness (bullish for power infrastructure, bearish for AI ops)
                                    - - Decline to $25-30/MWh → Excess capacity (bullish for compute expansion, bearish for power assets)
                                     
                                      - ---

                                      ### 2. Labor Arbitrage Ratio (Deflation Factor)

                                      **What It Measures:**
                                      The ratio of human worker hourly wages to the cost of AI token computation. Essentially: "How many hours of human labor equals the cost of running this AI operation?"

                                      **Calculation:**
                                      ```
                                      Labor Arbitrage = Human Wage ($/hour) / Token Computation Cost ($/token)
                                      ```

                                      **Technical Details:**
                                      - Human wage baseline: ~$42/hour (escalating to $45 over period)
                                      - - Token cost: $25/token (declining exponentially at 3% per period as scaling/efficiency improve)
                                        - - Ratio naturally rises as AI becomes cheaper relative to human labor
                                          - - Ranges from ~1.5x to 2.0x in this simulation
                                           
                                            - **Why It Matters:**
                                            - This metric captures the core economic driver of automation. It answers: "When is it cheaper to deploy AI than to hire humans?"
                                           
                                            - - **High ratio (>2.0)** = AI dramatically cheaper than human labor → strong automation incentive
                                              - - **Rising ratio** = AI getting cheaper faster than wage growth → accelerating automation
                                                - - **Falling ratio** = Wage growth outpacing AI cost reduction → slowing automation incentive
                                                 
                                                  - **Economic Interpretation:**
                                                  - This is fundamentally a *deflation signal* for human cognitive labor. In traditional macro terms:
                                                  - - Deflation in labor costs = Shift in comparative advantage away from human workers
                                                    - - Accelerating deflation = Structural economic shift (like automation in manufacturing)
                                                      - - Magnitude of deflation drives employment/wage dynamics
                                                       
                                                        - **For Macro Investors:**
                                                        - Track this to anticipate:
                                                        - - **Employment trends** → Accelerating automation when ratio >1.8x
                                                          - - **Wage pressure** → If ratio is rising despite wage growth, AI efficiency is the driver
                                                            - - **Sector rotation** → High-ratio periods favor capital-intensive tech, disfavor labor-intensive services
                                                              - - **Consumer spending** → Structural unemployment/underemployment as ratio rises (deflationary force)
                                                               
                                                                - **Example Signals:**
                                                                - - Ratio rising from 1.6x to 2.0x rapidly → Accelerating automation wave likely
                                                                  - - Ratio stalled at 1.5x → Labor costs keeping pace with AI improvements (less automation pressure)
                                                                    - - Ratio collapsing to <1.5x → Suggests AI cost reduction has slowed or human wages are rising
                                                                     
                                                                      - ---

                                                                      ## FACTORY Module: Velocity & Growth

                                                                      The FACTORY module measures the economic output and velocity of AI operations. It captures how much computation is being performed and how fast the AI economy is growing.

                                                                      ### 3. Agent Traffic (The Headless Web)

                                                                      **What It Measures:**
                                                                      The percentage of internet traffic driven by autonomous AI agents (bots, crawlers, LLM API calls) versus human users manually browsing/clicking.

                                                                      **Technical Details:**
                                                                      - Measured as percentage (0-100%)
                                                                      - - Baseline growth from 1.5% to 9.2% over simulation period
                                                                        - - Represents "headless" web traffic (no human in the loop)
                                                                          - - Includes random daily volatility (~0.2% noise)
                                                                           
                                                                            - **Why It Matters:**
                                                                            - This metric reveals the pace of AI *autonomous action* adoption. High Agent Traffic means:
                                                                            - - AI systems making decisions/transactions without human approval
                                                                              - - Economic value creation happening in machine-to-machine interactions
                                                                                - - Traditional web traffic (human clicks) becoming minority of activity
                                                                                  - - Economy becoming increasingly driven by AI actions, not human consumption
                                                                                   
                                                                                    - **Economic Interpretation:**
                                                                                    - This is like measuring the shift from "human labor economy" to "robot labor economy":
                                                                                    - - Traditional metrics (page views, click-through rates, e-commerce volume) become misleading
                                                                                      - - Must track *agent actions* as new economic indicator
                                                                                        - - Autonomous agent traffic = "work performed by AI" proxy
                                                                                         
                                                                                          - **For Macro Investors:**
                                                                                          - Rising Agent Traffic signals:
                                                                                          - - **AI adoption accelerating** → Moving from "AI as tool" to "AI as economic actor"
                                                                                            - - **Productivity growth** → Machine actions at massive scale (difficult to measure in traditional GDP)
                                                                                              - - **Automation phase transition** → Once Agent Traffic >5%, traditional employment metrics diverge from economic output
                                                                                                - - **New GDP components needed** → Traditional measurements miss machine-to-machine economic activity

Token GDP measures *potential* compute output. Power prices measure *cost*. Low power prices could mean computing is cheap even if demand is weak.

This would suggest labor market tightening and reduced automation incentive.
